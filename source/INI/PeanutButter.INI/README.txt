From Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

An INI file is a configuration file for computer software that consists of a text-based content with a structure and syntax comprising key-value pairs for properties, and sections that organize the properties.[1] The name of these configuration files comes from the filename extension INI, for initialization, used in the MS-DOS operating system which popularized this method of software configuration. The format has become an informal standard in many contexts of configuration, but many applications on other operating systems use different file name extensions, such as conf and cfg.[2]
